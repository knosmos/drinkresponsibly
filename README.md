Meet our protagonist Liong Ma. Liong Ma is the WOAT at beer pong: the worst of all time. However, his evil twin Miong La is the GOAT at beer pong. Thus, our team of heroes has banded together with one goal: help Liong Ma defeat the evil Miong La. To this end, we have constructed a beer pong robot that will magnetically move the cups on a table to assist our valiant yet unskilled hero while confounding his more accomplished evil twin. 

A single-axis or two-axis gantry mounted underneath the table moves a carriage with neodymium magnets. This will allow it to move cups on the top of the table (that also have magnets mounted inside of them). A vision system mounted overhead will allow for ping-pong ball tracking and trajectory estimation.

Potential practical applications of this magnetic gantry system could allow for assistance for the elderly or disabled in accessing space or objects they may not be able to access, giving them autonomy in daily tasks such as eating, work, and losing at beer pong.
